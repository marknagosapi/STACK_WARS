# STACK_WARS

# Introduction
When I made this github repo I was a I. year student at Sapientia University studying Computer Science.

In II. semester I had to take up a class named Data Structures & Algorithms. It was a difficult but interesting and challenging semester, 
which ended with an awesome idea! Let's make a project!

My project idea for the DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms) class which had had to include some sort of data structure. 

- My choice was the STACK!

# WHAT I USED?

HTML, CSS & JS that's all I used to create this little project.

# You can acces the website anytime!

The website is online by the help of netlify.com!
